# GREPO App

Created with [Expo](https://expo.dev/) is a remade version of the new grepolis app.

<br />
## Get started
Install nodejs dependencies
```bash
npn install
```

Start the development server
```
npm start
```
scan the qrcode with the Expo mobile app to see the live preview on your mobile

<br />
## How it works 
Works by taking the browser version of the game and injecting js to add or modify features and change graphics

I have not yet found a way to add the scripts (grepodata, grcrt, ...) but it is possible to program new ones and inject them in the application

<br />
## Features
✅ Swipe to switch polis
✅ Make City UI Bigger

<br />
## Build
#### Android:
To create the `apk` file to install it, use:
```bash
eas build -p android --profile preview
```
#### Ios:
TODO

<br />
## Planned:
- [ ] Keep fixing UI to make everything clickable in an easy way
- [ ] A way to convert the reports
- [ ] Better trading
